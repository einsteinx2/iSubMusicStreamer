This repo contains the code for the currently released version of iSub. Unfortunately I'm no longer actively developing the app. I was working on a complete Swift port and modernization (http://github.com/einsteinx2/iSub), however it became clear that I no longer have the time to complete that project. 

While I will no longer be developing either version of iSub, I will keep it working with new iOS releases and I'm happy to review and merge in any pull requests and push them to the App Store. So if you would like to fix a bug that's bothering you or add some functionality, feel free to do so and I will get it in the next App Store release.

Thank you to everyone for the years of support. It was a hard choice to give up this project, my first real programming project, but the reality became clear that it was impossible to continue. iSub is now free to download here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/isub-music-streamer/id362920532?mt=8
